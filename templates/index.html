  <h1><em>FIRST</em> Results by Phone</h1>
  <p>At a <em>FIRST</em> Robotics competition it can be hard to get the latest match information without walking
  to the pits, or using a smartphone. Even though smartphones are everywhere, many of the primary 
  participants in <em>FIRST</em> don't have smartphones.</p>

  <p>Call or text the phone number <strong>804-505-2659</strong> to find out about the team.</p>
  
  <p>Chances are you're reading this because someone on the <a href="http://firstteam1137.com">Mathews Robotics team</a>
  sent it to you.  They're team 1137, and will be playing in the qualifying rounds on Friday, March 21 and Saturday, March 22.
  Normal text and phone call rates apply to using the service, but the number is supposedly a local Mathews phone number so that
  families can find out how the team is doing without calling long distance (though we encourage texting to get the most info).</p>


  <h2>SMS</h2>
  <p>Send a team number and we'll quickly respond with information about that team from
  the {{event.name}}.</p>
  <h2>Call</h2>
  <p>Call and follow the instructions.  We'll read back to you almost everything we send in an SMS message.</p>

  <h2>Caveats</h2>
  <p>We don't have information about practice rounds (usually played on the Thursday of competition) because <em>FIRST</em>
  doesn't publish that information on the web.</p>

  <h2>Technical FAQs</h2>
  <h3>I found a bug. Can you fix it?</h3>
  <p>Please file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/pcfens/twilio-first-results">GitHub</a> and include as much
  information as possible.</p>
  <h3>How do you interact with phones?</h3>
  <p>We use the <a href="http://twilio.com">twilio</a> API.
  <h3>Where does your data come from?</h3>
  <p>We get our initial data from <a href="http://www.thebluealliance.com">The Blue Alliance</a>, then pull
  data directly from <em>FIRST</em> during the matches (once every minute) to give you the most up to date information possible.</p>
  <h3>Can I get the source?</h3>
  <p>Absolutely.  The project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/pcfens/twilio-first-results">GitHub</a>.
  If you put something together that others might benefit from, please send a pull request and I'll do my best
  to get your code in the version I maintain.</p>
  <h3>I saw the source code and it's really ugly. Is this how you code?</h3>
  <p>No. I came up with this idea and decided to write it using some tools that were new to me (Heroku, Flask, twilio-python), in the
  week before the team I mentor (<a href="http://firstteam1137.com">1137</a>) went to regionals.  Hopefully I'll get a chance
  to clean things up sometime soon.</p>
  <h3>Any other features planned?</h3>
  <p>I really want to have a basic web interface up and running before the Virginia Regional, but I can't promise that will
  happen.</p>
  <h3>How can I get in touch with you?</h3>
  <p><a href="mailto:phillip.fenstermacher+first@gmail.com">E-Mail</a> me.</p>
